# TimeSeriesPrediction
Predicting trading volume of S&amp;P500.

This project explores S&amp;P500 trading volume data and explores several models to predict next day volume. As a baseline, I have chosen a random walk. See full report in file `report.pdf`. Exploratory data analysis is provided in `0_eda.py`, and explored models (baseline, linear regression, exponential smoothing, (S)ARIMA and TFT transformer) are covered by `1_reference_model.py`, `2_linear_regression.py`, `3_ets.py`, `4_sarima.py` and `5_tft.py`.
